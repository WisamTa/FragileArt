## Testing

No automated testing has been used on this project, i have opted to do all testing manually and through numerous user experiences.

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠:
When i had set up the products fixtures and loaded into the database i could then view all saleable items in the store, i wanted to ensure all products loaded as expected and that item information was visable when selected.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™:
To test this, I went through each item and loaded the products information page, then looked at changing the url to ensure each item was loading correctly

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ:
All products loaded as expected to the main store page, some items were missing their images but they were still selectable and loaded their page correctly. When amending the url all items again loaded as expected however if i tried to access an item id that didn't exist i was presented with a 404 page.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ:
This test passed in it's basic form, amendments are required to the fixtures to ensure all the items images load correctly, also as the 404 page is the generic template provided with Django creating a custom page to handle these errors is desireable.

---

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠:
As with the store the portfolio page is populated from all items even if they aren't saleable. i need to ensure these load correctly to their specific pages and the overlays work correctly.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™:
To test this, I went through each item and loaded the portfolio item information page, then looked at changing the url to ensure each item was loading correctly

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ:
All portfolio items again populated the main page correctly, some with missing images and when clicked presented their specific pages with information displaying correctly.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ:
This test was deemed to be a pass, some minor edits are needed to the fixtures to ensure when the items are loaded out of development branches they are displaying as expected.

---

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠:
As a user can purchase items without signing in, i wanted to ensure that an order can be completed from start to finish.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™:
To test this i will select items at random and add them to the basket and proceed through checkout.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ:
Items were added to the basket correctly and the totals calculated as expected, going through the checkout process i was able to complete the order with stripes debug card ref and the order was confirmed and added to the db correctly.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ:
This test completed as expected without bugs.

---

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠:
With a logged in user, i want to make sure the user can view previous orders through the users account page.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™:
To test this i created a new user and proceeded to add items to the basket and complete the checkout process.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ:
As expected the checkout process completed and upon checking the users account page i could see the order details. upon completing multiple orders i was able to view these in a list as designed

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ:
This test completed as expected without bugs, it did flag a minor style change needed to the account page but information was present.

---

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠:
To ensure the user can navigate the site as expected i need to test each view and link to ensure the user isn't 'lost' within the page.

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™:
This test will be carried out by systematically navigating to each page from the previous and all links are clicked until all checked.

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ:
Each page and link was checked and each provided a positive result, at no point was the user sent to an unexpected destination.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ:
This test passed and no amendments were required.

---

- <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠:
To test the responsiveness of the site, the page was loaded on local mobile devices to check design choices

- <strong>Test</strong> üß™:
This test was carried out by loading the site and navigating to each page and adding and completing an order with more than one item

- <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ:
Each page loaded and displayed correctly, an issue was found with the basket which caused the table to overflow the edge of the page.

- <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ:
This test was classed as a fail and upon rereading the code a redesign of the basket was required to ensure mobile users were presented with the correct information that could be easily read.

Design Choices
Fonts
The artist has request that the site use Playfair Display as they feel this best suits their work and style they want to achieve.

As a secondary font i have chosen to use Montserrat to compliment this and allow for the extra content to stand out from the rest of the site content.

Colours
The client has specified #323e48 as their desired choice but has said they would allow anything to go with this as long as it contrasted well with the main colour choice.

With this information i have chosen to use the following colours to provide a great contrast and to help the content stand out.

## Features

### Exisiting Features

#### Portfolio

The portfolio section provides the artist a platform to add his works to the site and gives the user the chance to view all his current and past works in one place, each item has a description and a look at who the client for project was.

If the item is also available for sale then the user can also add this to their shopping cart.

#### Clients

The clients section of the site allows the user and potential new clients to see an overview of previous clients and in what field they operate also pointing the user to get in touch with the artist with regards to their own potential projects

#### Store

The store will provide the user the oppertunity to purchase any available products directly from the web page and this was previously handled through a third party site.

The user is able to add multiple items to the cart and either securely checkout in their current session or the items can be held until the user returns to the site later.

Payment is handle on the site and keeps the user in the same loop without having to redirect to a third party site.

#### Contact

The contact page allows the user a variety of methods to contact the artist in relation to either new potential clients or with regards to queries related to existing orders, potential orders or stock queries.


### Deploying to Heroku

the login command for heroku has changed. When the instructor logs in to heroku from the terminal, please use the following command:

heroku login -i

This will no longer open up the login page in the browser, instead it will prompt you for your username and password in the terminal itself.

NOTE: In case you have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) enabled, you'll need a few extra steps:

Click on Account Settings (via the avatar menu) on the Heroku Dashboard.
Scroll down to the API Key section and click Reveal. Copy the key.
Use the login command: heroku login -i
Enter your Heroku username.
Enter the API key you just copied when prompted for your password.
```

1. in the settings tab select Reveal Config Vars and copy the pre populated DATABASE_URL into your settings.py file in your project
1. in the Config Vars in Heroku you will need to populate with the following keys
